## Current Demo Script

### `demo-stop-loss-market-order-final.js`

This comprehensive demo script showcases the complete functionality of the **StopLossMarketOrderV2** extension integrated with the 1inch Limit Order Protocol.

#### Features Demonstrated

1. **üõ°Ô∏è Stop Loss Orders**
   - Automatic market order execution when price drops below threshold
   - WETH ‚Üí DAI conversion with 3800 DAI trigger price
   - Complete order lifecycle from creation to execution

2. **üìà Take Profit Orders**
   - Automatic market order execution when price rises above threshold
   - DAI ‚Üí WETH conversion with 4500 DAI trigger price
   - Demonstrates inverse stop loss behavior

3. **üî¢ Multi-decimal Token Support**
   - WETH (18 decimals) ‚Üî USDC (6 decimals) conversions
   - Proper decimal normalization for price calculations
   - Cross-decimal-precision order handling

4. **üîí Security Features**
   - Access control: Only order makers can configure their orders
   - Slippage protection: Maximum 50% slippage tolerance
   - Price deviation limits: Configurable per-block price change limits
   - Pause functionality: Emergency controls for contract operations

5. **‚öôÔ∏è 1inch Protocol Integration**
   - Native IAmountGetter interface implementation
   - Dynamic pricing based on oracle conditions
   - Seamless integration with existing 1inch infrastructure

6. **üìä TWAP Price Protection**
   - Time-weighted average pricing to prevent manipulation
   - Multi-block price history validation
   - Resistance against flash loan attacks

#### Usage

```bash
# Run the demo on Hardhat network
npx hardhat run scripts/demo-stop-loss-market-order-final.js --network hardhat

# Or with more detailed output
npx hardhat run scripts/demo-stop-loss-market-order-final.js --network localhost
```

#### Demo Flow

1. **Setup Phase**
   - Deploy base contracts (DAI, WETH, USDC, LimitOrderProtocol)
   - Deploy StopLossMarketOrderV2 extension and mock oracles
   - Configure extension settings and approvals
   - Mint tokens and set up participant balances

2. **Stop Loss Demo**
   - Create WETH‚ÜíDAI order with 3800 DAI stop price
   - Simulate price drop from 4000 to 3333 DAI/WETH
   - Trigger and execute stop loss order automatically

3. **Take Profit Demo**
   - Create DAI‚ÜíWETH order with 4500 DAI take profit price
   - Simulate price rise from 4000 to 4545 DAI/WETH
   - Show take profit configuration (note: execution depends on price calculation method)

4. **Multi-decimal Demo**
   - Show WETH (18) to USDC (6) decimal handling
   - Demonstrate proper price normalization

5. **Security Testing**
   - Test unauthorized access rejection
   - Test excessive slippage protection
   - Test pause/unpause functionality

#### Expected Output

The demo provides detailed console output showing:
- üìä Balance changes for all participants
- üíπ Oracle price movements and calculations
- ‚úÖ Successful execution confirmations
- üîç Trigger status checks
- üéØ Order execution results

#### Key Contracts Used

- **StopLossMarketOrderV2**: Main extension contract
- **MutableAggregatorMock**: Price oracle for testing
- **MockAggregationRouter**: Simulated 1inch router
- **LimitOrderProtocol**: Core 1inch protocol
- **Token Mocks**: DAI, WETH, USDC test tokens
